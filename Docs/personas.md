## Persona: Sophie van der Berg

### Demographics
- **Name:** Sophie van der Berg
- **Age:** 32
- **Location:** Amsterdam, Netherlands
- **Occupation:** Implementation Lead at Freeday
- **Income:** €65,000 - €75,000
- **Education:** MSc Business Information Systems, VU Amsterdam

### Profile Picture Description
Energetic Dutch woman in her early 30s, short auburn hair, usually wearing smart-casual attire with colorful accessories. Often seen with multiple browser tabs open and a reusable water bottle.

### Bio
Sophie joined Freeday two years ago after working at a management consultancy. She was drawn to the startup energy and the promise of actually building something instead of just advising. She now leads 4-6 Digital Employee implementations simultaneously, juggling client workshops, technical configurations, and stakeholder management.

She's proud of her client relationships but frustrated by the administrative overhead. Every implementation generates mountains of meeting notes, scope changes, and technical requirements that she captures in a chaotic mix of Notion pages, Google Docs, and sticky notes. She's lost count of how many times she's had to dig through recordings to find "that one thing the client said about exceptions."

Sophie is the primary user the OCC was built for - everything should make her life easier.

### Goals
1. **Primary goal:** Complete implementations on time with minimal rework during UAT
2. **Secondary goal:** Build a reputation as the go-to lead for complex implementations
3. **Hidden goal:** Prove that the messy parts of implementation can be systematized (she wants to be promoted to lead a team)

### Frustrations
1. Spending 30% of her time on admin tasks instead of client work
2. Losing track of scope discussions buried in 2-hour recordings
3. Clients asking "didn't we discuss this?" and not being able to find evidence
4. Starting every new implementation from scratch with no templates

### Tech Profile
- **Tech savviness:** 4/5 - Very comfortable with SaaS tools, can do basic SQL
- **Devices:** MacBook Pro, iPhone 14, rarely uses tablet
- **Apps they love:** Notion (flexibility), Loom (async video), Figma (visual collaboration)
- **Apps they hate:** Jira (over-engineered), SAP (client systems she has to navigate)

### A Day in Their Life
**Morning:**
Checks Slack for urgent messages, reviews today's client schedule (usually 2-3 sessions). Preps by reviewing last session notes - often scrambles to find them.

**Workday:**
Back-to-back Design Week sessions or technical workshops. Between calls, she's updating scope documents, answering client emails, or configuring test environments. Lunch is eaten at desk while catching up on Slack.

**Evening:**
Tries to disconnect but often ends up "quickly" documenting something she'll forget by morning. Yoga class twice a week helps her decompress.

### Quotes
> "I spend more time looking for information than actually using it. My brain is full of 'I think the client mentioned this in session 3... or was it 4?'"

> "I wish the scope document could write itself from our conversations."

### How They'd Find Your App
Internal tool - assigned by management, but she'd be excited to try anything that promises less admin work.

### What Would Make Them Love It
- Automatic extraction of scope items from recordings
- Clear progress tracking without manual status updates
- Searchable evidence linked to exact timestamps
- Templates that pre-populate from previous implementations

### What Would Make Them Leave
- More data entry than her current process
- Slow or unreliable AI extractions
- Can't access it on mobile when away from desk
- Doesn't integrate with client-facing artifacts

### Willingness to Pay
N/A - Internal tool, but would advocate strongly if it saves her 5+ hours/week

## Persona: Priya Sharma

### Demographics
- **Name:** Priya Sharma
- **Age:** 41
- **Location:** London, UK (manages remote team)
- **Occupation:** Head of Implementation at Freeday
- **Income:** €95,000 - €110,000 + bonus
- **Education:** MBA from London Business School, BSc Computer Science from IIT Delhi

### Profile Picture Description
Polished Indian-British woman in her early 40s, often in video calls with a professional home office background. Silver streak in otherwise dark hair, reading glasses perched on head when not in use.

### Bio
Priya built Freeday's implementation practice from 2 people to a team of 12. She's seen every type of implementation failure and knows that most problems come from unclear scope, missing prerequisites, or optimistic timelines. She doesn't do hands-on implementation anymore but needs visibility into her team's portfolio.

Her biggest challenge is predicting which implementations will go sideways. By the time issues surface, they've usually been brewing for weeks. She wants early warning systems, not post-mortems.

### Goals
1. **Primary goal:** Deliver 95% of implementations on time and within scope
2. **Secondary goal:** Scale the team without quality degradation
3. **Hidden goal:** Prove to the board that implementation is a profit center, not a cost center

### Frustrations
1. Learning about blocked implementations in Friday standups, not in real-time
2. No visibility into prerequisite status until a lead escalates
3. Can't answer CEO's "how many implementations can we take on?" without checking with each lead
4. Resource allocation is guesswork

### Tech Profile
- **Tech savviness:** 3/5 - Comfortable with dashboards and reports, doesn't configure tools herself
- **Devices:** MacBook Air, iPhone, iPad for reading
- **Apps they love:** Slack (quick pulse checks), Looker (data visualization), Calendar (blocks for deep work)
- **Apps they hate:** Tools that require training to use, anything that sends too many notifications

### A Day in Their Life
**Morning:**
30 minutes reviewing dashboards and overnight messages before 9am team standup. Flags anything concerning for follow-up.

**Workday:**
Mix of 1:1s with leads, client escalation calls, and strategic planning. Blocks 2 hours daily for "no meetings" but it's often invaded. Reviews capacity and pipeline weekly.

**Evening:**
Family dinner is sacred. Might check messages once after kids are in bed but actively trying to disconnect.

### Quotes
> "I shouldn't need to ask Sophie how the Acme implementation is going - I should be able to see it."

> "A red flag on Monday is fixable. The same red flag on Friday is a client crisis."

### How They'd Find Your App
Would be involved in the decision to adopt internally. Evaluates based on "will this give me the visibility I need?"

### What Would Make Them Love It
- Portfolio view showing all implementations with health indicators
- Automatic risk detection (blocked prerequisites, slow progress)
- Gantt-style timeline view for capacity planning
- Zero configuration - it should just work with data leads enter

### What Would Make Them Leave
- Requires her to manually check each implementation
- Leads have to do extra work to give her visibility
- Data is stale or inaccurate
- Can't export for board presentations

### Willingness to Pay
N/A - Internal tool, but would champion budget allocation for it

## Persona: Thomas Bakker

### Demographics
- **Name:** Thomas Bakker
- **Age:** 27
- **Location:** Utrecht, Netherlands
- **Occupation:** Support Engineer at Freeday
- **Income:** €45,000 - €52,000
- **Education:** HBO Applied IT, minor in AI

### Profile Picture Description
Young Dutch man with a friendly face, usually wearing headphones around his neck. Gaming setup visible in background of home office. Keeps a rubber duck on his desk for debugging.

### Bio
Thomas is on the front line when Digital Employees misbehave. When a client reports that "the bot said something weird," Thomas is the one who investigates. His challenge: he wasn't part of the Design Week sessions, so he often doesn't know what was agreed as in-scope vs. out-of-scope.

He's asked leads to share scope documents dozens of times. Sometimes they do, sometimes he gets a 47-page Google Doc that takes longer to read than to just ask the client what happened.

Thomas dreams of a support tool that actually helps him instead of being another system to log tickets in.

### Goals
1. **Primary goal:** Resolve support tickets quickly with accurate information
2. **Secondary goal:** Identify patterns that indicate systematic issues (not just one-off bugs)
3. **Hidden goal:** Move into implementation or product roles - support is a stepping stone

### Frustrations
1. No centralized place to look up "what should this DE do?"
2. Scope documents are out of date by the time DE goes live
3. Can't tell if client is asking for something new or complaining about missing functionality
4. No visibility into what was discussed during Design Week

### Tech Profile
- **Tech savviness:** 5/5 - Most technical person using the platform
- **Devices:** Custom PC, secondary laptop for work, Android phone
- **Apps they love:** Linear (clean issue tracking), Raycast (speed), Discord (community)
- **Apps they hate:** Salesforce (clunky), anything that requires clicking through 5 screens

### A Day in Their Life
**Morning:**
Checks overnight tickets from US/Asia clients. Prioritizes based on severity. Often has to wake up a DE's knowledge base to remind himself what it's supposed to do.

**Workday:**
Ticket triage, investigation, escalation to engineering if needed. Documents workarounds. Occasionally joins live calls with frustrated clients.

**Evening:**
Gaming with friends online, contributing to open source projects, or learning new tech. Works on side projects.

### Quotes
> "The scope document says 'handle claims' but doesn't tell me which types of claims, what data it needs, or what happens when that data is missing."

> "I wish I could just type 'what should this DE do when the customer mentions legal action?' and get an answer."

### How They'd Find Your App
Internal tool - would be told to use it for support lookups. Initial skepticism but willing to give it a chance.

### What Would Make Them Love It
- Instant search across all scope items and scenarios
- Clear documentation of edge cases and escalation rules
- Evidence links showing "why" a decision was made
- API access so he can build integrations

### What Would Make Them Leave
- Search that doesn't understand his queries
- Missing or outdated information
- Slow performance
- No keyboard shortcuts

### Willingness to Pay
N/A - Internal tool, but would actively use and provide feedback

## Persona: Marcus Chen

### Demographics
- **Name:** Marcus Chen
- **Age:** 45
- **Location:** Chicago, IL (works with EU company on digital transformation)
- **Occupation:** VP of Operations at Acme Insurance (Freeday client)
- **Income:** $180,000 - $210,000
- **Education:** MBA Northwestern Kellogg, BA Economics from UC Berkeley

### Profile Picture Description
Asian-American executive in his mid-40s, silver temples, often in video calls from a corner office with city views. Prefers button-downs without ties. Has a family photo visible on his desk.

### Bio
Marcus sponsors the Digital Employee initiative at Acme. He doesn't need to know how the AI works - he needs to know if it's going to hit his operational targets. His board presentation in 3 months needs to show ROI, and his team is skeptical that "a chatbot" can handle their complex claims process.

He's been burned by vendor implementations before. His trust is earned through transparency, not demos. He wants to see progress without having to schedule weekly status calls.

### Goals
1. **Primary goal:** 30% reduction in claims processing time within 6 months of go-live
2. **Secondary goal:** Free up his team from repetitive inquiries to focus on complex cases
3. **Hidden goal:** Position himself as an innovation leader for his next career move

### Frustrations
1. "Black box" implementations where he only sees problems when they surface
2. Scope creep that delays timelines
3. Can't explain to his board what's taking so long
4. Vendor presentations that show happy paths but hide complexity

### Tech Profile
- **Tech savviness:** 2/5 - Uses tools but doesn't configure them. Relies on assistants for tech setup.
- **Devices:** Company laptop, iPhone (latest), iPad for reading
- **Apps they love:** Outlook (lives in it), PowerPoint (communication tool), his company's BI dashboard
- **Apps they hate:** Anything requiring training, tools with "modern" UIs he finds confusing

### A Day in Their Life
**Morning:**
Reviews overnight emails, scans dashboard for operational metrics. Coffee with direct reports to discuss priorities.

**Workday:**
Meetings with vendors, internal stakeholders, and board prep. Signs off on major decisions. Delegates detail work.

**Evening:**
Family dinner, catches up on industry news, occasionally reviews documents shared by his team.

### Quotes
> "I don't need to know how it works. I need to know when it will work and what's blocking it."

> "If there's a problem, I want to hear it from you before I hear it from my team."

### How They'd Find Your App
Would be given read-only access by Freeday as part of the transparency commitment. Sophie would walk him through it once.

### What Would Make Them Love It
- Simple timeline showing milestones and status
- Clear indication of what HE needs to provide (prerequisites)
- Progress that updates without him asking
- Exportable status for his board slides

### What Would Make Them Leave
- Complexity he doesn't need
- Having to log in frequently
- Information that requires Freeday context to understand
- No mobile access for quick checks

### Willingness to Pay
His company pays Freeday - he'd see this as part of the service expectation.

## Persona: Lisa Jansen

### Demographics
- **Name:** Lisa Jansen
- **Age:** 29
- **Location:** Rotterdam, Netherlands
- **Occupation:** Account Executive at Freeday
- **Income:** €55,000 base + €20,000-€40,000 commission
- **Education:** BSc International Business, Erasmus University Rotterdam

### Profile Picture Description
Confident young Dutch woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, sharp dresser who adapts her style to the client - blazer for corporates, smart-casual for startups. Always has her phone in hand and a pitch-ready smile.

### Bio
Lisa is one of Freeday's top-performing Account Executives. She's the one who convinces companies to bet on Digital Employees - she gets the meetings, builds the relationships, handles objections, and closes the deals. She's great at painting the vision of what a DE can do for a client's operations.

Her biggest frustration? The moment after the deal is signed. She's spent weeks building trust with the client, understanding their pain points, documenting their requirements in proposals and SOWs - and then the handover to implementation feels like throwing a package over a wall. She writes a handover email, schedules an intro call, and hopes for the best. Half the time, the implementation lead asks questions she's already answered in the proposal. The other half, important context about client politics or verbal promises gets lost entirely.

Lisa knows that bad handovers create unhappy clients, and unhappy clients don't renew. But she doesn't have time to sit through Design Week sessions - she has the next deal to close. She needs a way to transfer everything she knows about a client in a structured, reliable way that doesn't eat into her selling time.

### Goals
1. **Primary goal:** Close deals and hit quarterly targets without post-sale headaches
2. **Secondary goal:** Ensure smooth handovers so clients stay happy and renew (affects her long-term commission)
3. **Hidden goal:** Be seen as a strategic seller, not just a closer - she wants to eventually become Head of Sales

### Frustrations
1. Spending 2-3 hours per deal manually writing handover documents that nobody reads completely
2. Getting pinged by implementation leads weeks later asking for context she already provided somewhere
3. Client complaints about "we already told the sales person this" during Design Week
4. No feedback loop - she never knows if her handovers were actually useful
5. Verbal promises she made during sales calls that aren't documented anywhere formal

### Tech Profile
- **Tech savviness:** 3/5 - Comfortable with sales tools, doesn't go deep into configuration
- **Devices:** MacBook Air, iPhone 15 Pro (always), AirPods for constant calls
- **Apps they love:** HubSpot (her CRM home), Gong (reviews her own calls), Notion (quick deal notes), WhatsApp (client relationships)
- **Apps they hate:** Complex tools that require training, anything with more than 3 clicks to do a simple task, systems that feel "engineered for engineers"

### A Day in Their Life
**Morning:**
Reviews pipeline in HubSpot. Preps for 2-3 prospect calls or demos. Checks LinkedIn for engagement on posts she made. Responds to client WhatsApp messages from the night before.

**Workday:**
Discovery calls, demos, proposal reviews, and negotiation meetings. Between calls, she's updating CRM records, writing follow-up emails, and coordinating internally with solutions consultants. When a deal closes, she scrambles to write a handover document before the celebration dinner.

**Evening:**
Networking events once or twice a week. Otherwise, she's either prepping proposals or genuinely disconnected - she believes in hard work/hard rest. Weekend brunches with friends where she inevitably talks about her latest deal.

### Quotes
> "I close the deal in 6 weeks, then spend 3 hours writing a handover doc that captures maybe 60% of what I know. The other 40% lives in my head and in 14 different email threads."

> "When a client calls me 3 months later saying 'we told your sales team about this requirement' and it wasn't captured - that's my reputation on the line, not just implementation's problem."

> "I don't want to attend Design Week. I just want to make sure everything I know ends up in the right hands without me having to be there."

### How They'd Find Your App
Would be introduced by Priya or Sophie when the handover process is formalized. Initial reaction: "Another system?" but would quickly adopt if it saves her handover writing time.

### What Would Make Them Love It
- Upload a proposal/SOW and have the system extract deal context automatically
- Quick handover form that takes 15 minutes instead of 2 hours
- AI that pulls context from her CRM notes and call recordings
- Confirmation that the implementation team has reviewed her handover
- Notification when the implementation is going well (or badly) - feedback loop
- Being able to tag verbal promises during calls and have them tracked through implementation

### What Would Make Them Leave
- Takes longer than her current handover process
- Requires her to learn complex workflows
- No visibility into whether her input was actually used
- System feels "internal/technical" rather than sales-friendly
- Has to manually re-enter data that already exists in HubSpot or Gong

### Willingness to Pay
N/A - Internal tool, but would champion it if it reduces post-sale friction and client churn

## Persona Summary

| Persona | Type | Primary Goal | Key Frustration | Tech Level |
|---------|------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| Sophie van der Berg | Power User | Complete implementations on time | 30% time on admin instead of clients | 4/5 |
| Priya Sharma | Executive User | 95% on-time delivery across portfolio | Learning about issues too late | 3/5 |
| Thomas Bakker | Technical User | Resolve tickets quickly with accurate info | No centralized scope documentation | 5/5 |
| Marcus Chen | External Client | 30% reduction in processing time | Black box implementations | 2/5 |
| Lisa Jansen | Sales Handover User | Close deals without post-sale headaches | Handover docs capture only 60% of context | 3/5 |

### Coverage Analysis

**Use cases covered:**
- Day-to-day implementation work (Sophie)
- Portfolio oversight and resource planning (Priya)
- Post-live support and troubleshooting (Thomas)
- Client visibility and stakeholder management (Marcus)
- Sales-to-implementation handoff (Lisa)

**Use cases NOT covered:**
- Engineering/configuration specialists
- Executive sponsors at Freeday (CEO, etc.)

### Key Insights Across Personas

1. **Everyone wants visibility** - Sophie wants scope visibility, Priya wants portfolio visibility, Thomas wants DE capability visibility, Marcus wants progress visibility, Lisa wants handover confirmation visibility. Visibility is the core value proposition.

2. **Nobody wants more admin work** - Every persona mentioned frustration with manual processes. Any feature that adds steps will be rejected. Lisa especially won't adopt anything slower than her current email+doc approach.

3. **Evidence matters** - Sophie needs evidence for scope discussions, Thomas needs evidence for support, Priya needs evidence for escalations, Marcus needs evidence for his board, Lisa needs evidence that promises were captured and tracked.

4. **Tension: Detail vs. Summary** - Sophie needs granular extraction data. Priya needs executive dashboards. Marcus needs even simpler views. Lisa needs a quick input, rich output experience. The same underlying data must be surfaced at different altitudes.

5. **The handover gap is a chain reaction** - Lisa's lost context becomes Sophie's missing information, which becomes Thomas's unsearchable scope, which becomes Marcus's "we already told you this" complaint. Fixing the handover fixes downstream problems for everyone.

### Design Implications

- **Sophie's view should be the default** - She's the primary user; optimize for her workflow first
- **Priya's view is aggregated Sophie views** - Don't build separate systems; aggregate upward
- **Thomas needs search, not navigation** - He arrives with a question, not a workflow
- **Marcus gets the simplest possible view** - Hide internal complexity, show milestones and blockers
- **Lisa needs speed and confirmation** - Quick input (upload + 15min form), clear confirmation that implementation received it, and a feedback loop on how the deal is progressing
- **All personas benefit from AI extraction** - It reduces Sophie's admin, gives Priya real-time data, gives Thomas searchable scope, keeps Marcus informed without meetings, and lets Lisa hand over context without writing a novel
- **The Sales Handover tab is Lisa's primary touchpoint** - It should feel sales-friendly, not implementation-technical. Consider a separate entry point or simplified view for sales users
